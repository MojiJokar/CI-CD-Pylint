In a nutshell, every workflow consists of several different core concepts. These include:
• Events : Events are defined triggers that kick off a workflow. They can be set to run on specific coding branches within a given repository on GitHub.

• Jobs : Jobs are a set of steps that execute on the same runner. Each runs in its VM and parallel to other jobs.

• Steps : Steps are individual tasks that run commands in a job. These can be an action or a shell command. All steps in a job execute on the same runner.

• Actions : An action is a command that is executed on a runner and the core element of GitHub Actions, which is named after it.

• Runners : A runner is a GitHub Actions server. It listens for available jobs, runs each in parallel, and reports back progress, logs, and results. Each runner can be hosted by GitHub or self-hosted on a localized server. GitHub Hosted runners are based on Ubuntu Linux, Windows, and macOS
